This repository's goal is to serve as an information hub for machine learning and Docker. 


In the AI directory, you will find an assortment of machine learning problems with their solutions. In additon to this, there are complimentary comments that explain how each algorithm works and the code for them using either Scikit-learn or Tensorflow/Keras.


The Docker directory will lead you through a test example of how to write a Dockerfile and deploy a container through the terminal.
